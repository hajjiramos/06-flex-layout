# 06-flex-layout
Flexbox is useful for Laying out entire Webpages and smaller components of the page. 

Hints:
CSS remove List <li> bullets
CSS remove Link underline decoration

Added height: 100vh to the body... this makes the body exactly the same height as the viewport.

To stick the footer to the bottom you will need to use flex and change the direction to column.
